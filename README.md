# Arkatsu

### This iOS app was created for motivating students to take part in University's events. 

Overall, it has several categories: `education`, `sport`, `party`, `volunteering`. In each category, there are some goals that user can reach. For example, to visit the University library for the first time, to play three soccer games, to plant a tree, etc. Also, there is a pet in AR, that grows and upgrades his level as soon as user gets some achievements. This element of gamification takes his motivation to use the app, to beat goals and to participate in the life of the University to a new level.
